1. Project Objective
Define the Goal: Understand what you aim to achieve with the project. For example, identifying accident hotspots, understanding the most common causes of accidents, or assessing the impact of safety measures over time.
2. Data Collection
Sources: Identify where you will get your data from. This could include public datasets, internal records, or real-time data feeds.
Relevance: Ensure the data includes relevant information, such as date and time of accidents, locations, causes, types of accidents, involved parties, and outcomes (injuries, fatalities, etc.).
3. Data Preparation
Cleaning: Remove or correct inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and duplicates in the data.
Transformation: Convert data into a format suitable for analysis. This might include creating new columns (e.g., extracting the day of the week from a date), merging datasets, or aggregating data.
4. Data Modeling
Relationships: Define how different data tables relate to each other, if you're using multiple datasets.
Measures and Calculations: Create measures (aggregations and calculations) that are relevant to your analysis, such as total number of accidents, average severity, or trends over time.
5. Visualization
Dashboards: Design dashboards that present the data in an insightful and accessible manner.
Maps for geographical analysis of accidents.
Time series charts for trends over days, months, or years.
Bar or column charts for comparing accident counts by cause, type, or outcome.
Pie charts for distribution of a particular variable, though be mindful of their best use cases.
Interactivity: Include slicers, filters, and drill-downs to allow users to explore the data dynamically.
6. Insights and Reporting
Analytical Insights: Use the visualizations to draw insights. Look for patterns, anomalies, or correlations.
Report Generation: Power BI allows you to generate reports that can be shared with stakeholders to make informed decisions.
7. Implementation and Feedback
Deployment: Publish your Power BI report to the Power BI service so that it can be accessed by users on different devices.
Gather Feedback: After deployment, collect feedback from users to understand what works and what can be improved.
8. Iteration
Continuous Improvement: Update the project periodically based on new data, feedback, and evolving project goals.
9. Compliance and Ethics
Data Privacy: Ensure your project complies with data protection regulations (like GDPR if applicable) and ethical considerations, especially if personal data is involved.
