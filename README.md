1. Project Objective
Define the Goal: U identifying accident hotspots, understanding the most common causes of accidents, or assessing the impact of safety measures over time.
2. Data Collection
Sources: got a raw data ,public datasets, internal records, or real-time data feeds.
Relevance: Ensure the data includes relevant information, such as date and time of accidents, locations, causes, types of accidents, involved parties, and outcomes (injuries, fatalities, etc.).
3. Data Preparation
Cleaning: Remove or correct inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and duplicates in the data.
Transformation: Convert data into a format suitable for analysis. This might include creating new columns (e.g., extracting the day of the week from a date), merging datasets, or aggregating data.
4. Data Modeling
Relationships: Define how different data tables relate to each other, if you're using multiple datasets.
Measures and Calculations: Create measures (aggregations and calculations) that are relevant to  analysis, such as total number of accidents, average severity, or trends over time.
5. Visualization
Dashboards: Design dashboards that present the data in an insightful and accessible manner.

Time series charts for trends over days, months, or years.
Bar or column charts for comparing accident counts by cause, type, or outcome.
Pie charts for distribution of a particular variable, though be mindful of their best use cases.

Analytical Insights: Use the visualizations to draw insights. Look for patterns, anomalies, or correlations.

6.Tools and Technologies
Power BI Desktop for creating reports and dashboards.
Power BI Service for publishing, sharing, and collaborating on reports.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for more complex data manipulations and measures.
Power Query for data preparation and transformation.
